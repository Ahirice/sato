Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency and its own digital payment system.
• Most widely used cryptocurrency
• The oldest and most well known
• No centralized governing body
Bitcoin is now more than ten years old an many other cryptocurrencies now exist. 
Still, Bitcoin is the most important one, and represents about 35% of the total capitalization of the crypto markets.

With its wide adoption, Bitcoin is facing several challenges as the network grows:
- Keeping the transaction cost low enough for it to be viable for transfer
- Keeping the transaction speed fast enough for BTC to be usable
- Avoiding centralization of the network, especially on the miner side
